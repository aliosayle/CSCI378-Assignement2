/* 
 An array implementation of the Queue ADT with operations: create, enqueue,
 dequeue, head, tail, isEmpty, and isFull.
 The Queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure.
 A cell is kept empty to differentiate between an empty queue and a full one.
 Assumption 1: head is the index of the cell that precedes the first element
 Assumption 2: tail is the index of the cell that contains the last element
